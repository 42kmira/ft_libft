# libft
This is my submitted version of libft.
An improved version called [libft_plus](https://github.com/MrColour/libft_plus) can be found [here](https://github.com/MrColour/libft_plus).
This would be my second draft of libft. The first one used conventional methods,
while the second used less conventional methods for the purpose of performance.

## How better you ask?
Below is a picture of the performance difference I was able to get. This is relative to my old_libft whose source code
can be found in the folder old_libft.

## But is it safe?
Bellow are the pictures of it passing MOULINETTE, [42FileChecker](https://github.com/jgigault/42FileChecker), [Libft-unit-test](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test), and [Libftest](https://github.com/jtoty/Libftest).
There is nothing lost with the performance boost, and the functions are deemed okay by MOULINETTE
